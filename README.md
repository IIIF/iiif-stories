# IIIF User Stories

_See the [issues](https://github.com/IIIF/iiif-stories/issues) associated with this repository._

The intention is to collect user stories that will drive the development of [IIIF specifications](http://iiif.io/technical-details.html). Please:

  * Check the current set of user stories before creating a new one. If a similar story exists then add comments instead of creating a new one.
  * Use a reasonably short titles but be sure to repeat any information in the title in the initial comment (because the title might be changed later).
  * Feel free to use the tradition user story template ("As a _role_, I want _goal/desire_ so that _benefit_") or a use case style as you see fit. Include links to any useful examples or supporting material.
  * Assign one or more labels to help categorize the story.
  * Be prepared to help clarify or expand the story if others comment on it.
  
Issues should be [closed](https://github.com/IIIF/iiif-stories/issues?q=is%3Aclosed%20is%3Aissue) with an appropriate label when they are either:

  * [`supported`](https://github.com/IIIF/iiif-stories/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Asupported) - current published specifications support the use case.
  * [`client-issue`](https://github.com/IIIF/iiif-stories/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Aclient-issue) - use case describes client-side issue rather than a IIIF specification issue.
  * [`wontfix`](https://github.com/IIIF/iiif-stories/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Awontfix) - use case will not be addressed in IIIF work, perhaps because it is [`outofscope?`](https://github.com/IIIF/iiif-stories/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Aoutofscope%3F%20) or [`invalid`](https://github.com/IIIF/iiif-stories/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Ainvalid%20)
